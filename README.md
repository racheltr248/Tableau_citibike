# Tableau_citibike
## Overview
The stakeholder is interested in creating a bike-sharing program in their hometown. In order to solidify the proposal to investors, I have used Pandas and Tableau to analyze bike trip data from New York City. 

## Results

### The first level of analysis looked at location
#### The start station map demonstrates that stations all over the city were utilized

#### However, the top 10 stations all lay within the downtown area, indicating that the service is more popular in more urban areas

### The second level of analysis looked at user demographics
#### Men used the service more than women did

## Summary
This survey of the use data is an important step in determining if Des Moines, Iowa will be able to support a successful Citibike service. The next step will be to compare the demographics and level of urbanization between Des Moines and New York City and determine how to scale the service to fit.
